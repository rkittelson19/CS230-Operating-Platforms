# CS230-Operating-Platforms

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

My client The Gaming Room is a company that currently has an Android game (application) called Draw It or Lose It. They came to me looking for a solution to get their existing game onto multiple platforms. We designed a web-based game to help with their problem. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I did a particularly good job with the beginning section of the document. Coming up with the technical constraints as well as analyzing the UML model I felt strongly about. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I felt that the UML class diagram was extremely helpful in developing the code. Since it lists the methods required as well as attributes, constructors, and relationships it made things very easy to develop the code.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise one section it would be the evaluation piece. I felt like it was difficult to differentiate the different devices looking at a web-based application environment. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I made sure when planning to implement the user's needs by focusing on a web-based application. It is important to consider teh user's needs because they are the reason you are being paid, and in the end they are who the work is for.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached designing software by first utilizing the different diagrams I have available to me. I am very much a visual learner, so these diagrams were helpful in planning out the system in my head. If I approached a similar software application in the future, I would make an effort to spend extra time in the planning phase so that the implementation phase goes smoother for me.
